As part of our research project, we analyzed employee data for Pewlett Hackard from the 1980s and 1990s. The data was provided in six CSV files, which we imported into a SQL database. We then designed tables to hold the data and used SQL queries to answer questions about the data.

We used ER modeling to design the tables for the employee data. The ER model helped us identify the entities, attributes, and relationships between the data elements. We created tables for employees, departments, department employees, salaries, titles, and department managers.

We imported the CSV files into a SQL database and created tables to hold the data. We also defined primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes for the tables. We used SQL commands to create tables, insert data, and modify table structures as needed.

We used SQL queries to analyze the employee data and answer questions about the data. We analyzed employee salaries, employee titles, and employee departments. We also identified the managers of each department and the frequency of employee last names.



Conclusion:
Through our analysis of the employee data, we were able to gain insights into Pewlett Hackard's workforce from the 1980s and 1990s. Our analysis helped us understand the distribution of salaries, job titles, and departments. It also helped us identify the managers of each department and the frequency of employee last names. We hope this analysis will help Pewlett Hackard better understand its past workforce and inform its future hiring strategies.
